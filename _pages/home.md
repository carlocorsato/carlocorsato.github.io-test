### About
*Thinking 3D* will put the 21st century mind in touch with the legacy of some of the greatest artists and thinkers through the medium of books, manuscripts, prints and drawings, offering a cluster of exhibitions and events which will tell the story of the communication of three-dimensionality and the impact that the developments of related techniques had on artists and draughtsman throughout time and across space. The theme is of great relevance today, as amateur and professional designers are constantly thinking about how to communicate three-dimensional forms in traditional bi-dimensional media or by using computer software and 3D printing.

### Research

At the heart of *Thinking 3D* is a collaborative research initiative to bring together topic-specialists in humanities, sciences, fine art, engineering and industry to discuss how the concept of three-dimensionality has affected their field. Historic surveys and accounts of current practices can tell us much about how we have conceived and communicated three-dimensionality. *Thinking 3D* is as much about the history of the concept as it is about understanding how three-dimensionality has affected, or is currently affecting, technological development and in converse how these developments are helping us understand and communicate more clearly three dimensional concepts. *Thinking 3D* will bring together research in order to illuminate the countless ways that this concept has evolved, influenced change, and affected the way that we perceive and communicate in our modern world.

### Exhibitions
